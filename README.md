# âš½ Football AI Analyzer

This project performs **football formation detection**, **player & ball tracking**, and computes metrics like **speed**, **distance covered**, and **ball possession** using computer vision and deep learning techniques.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Using match footage as input, this system extracts tactical insights including:
- Player & ball tracking
- Team formation classification
- Spatial metric analysis (speed, distance)
- Ball possession estimation

Itâ€™s built with **YOLOv11**, **OpenCV**, **Ultralytics**, **K-Means**, and **CNN**.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **YOLOv11-based player and ball detection**
- **Optical flow for stable tracking**
- **ResNet-18 CNN for formation classification**
- **Speed & distance calculations**
- **Possession time tracking**
- **Perspective transformation for spatial analysis**
- **Team segmentation using K-means**
